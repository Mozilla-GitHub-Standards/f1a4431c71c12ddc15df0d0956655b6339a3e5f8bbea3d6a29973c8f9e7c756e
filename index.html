			<h1>Firefox Academic Center</h1>
			<h4>Mozilla and Telefonica are seeking proposals from faculty to explore novel capabilities and services on the first mobile operating system that relies on open web standards – the Firefox OS. After proposals in 2013, one successful organization will receive a research award to establish the first Firefox academic center in 2014.</h4>
			<h4>What is Firefox OS?</h4>
			<p>Firefox OS (also referred to by its codename "Boot to Gecko" or "B2G") is Mozilla's open source mobile operating system based on Linux and Mozilla's Gecko technology. It relies on open web standards, is free from proprietary technology, and provides a powerful platform for application developers to create excellent products. For Web developers, the key to understanding Firefox OS is to realize that  every app is simply a Web page comprised of HTML5 and Javascript that uses open Web APIs to communicate with the device hardware and services. Firefox OS launches commercially in 2013.</p>
			<h4>What will be awarded?</h4>
			<p>To establish the first Firefox Academic Center, the winning organization will receive 30 <a href="http://shop.geeksphone.com/en/phones/5-peak.html" target="_blank">GeeksPhone Peek devices</a> with SIM cards plus modest funds to cover data plans for an entire year. One Mozilla and one Telefonica engineer will visit the organization and provide a 2-day bootcamp to quickly familiarize researchers with the new web operating system. <em>What about IP -- no strings? all a gift?</em> Further support will be available via the usual channels provided by Mozilla’s development community. We anticipate further awards if the model is successful.</p>
			<h4>How do I submit a proposal?</h4>
			<p>Interested faculty should send a proposal by email to TBD by December 15th 2013. The proposal should be submitted in PDF and not exceed 4 pages in length. Proposals should describe the research vision and short-term goal for a one year timeframe, the team, and how the mobiles will be used. A wide range of research topics in mobile computing is of interest including: security of web apps; system support for network usage and energy consumption; integration across the mobile device and cloud platforms; structuring apps for browsers and mobiles; and novel apps that highlight the capabilities of the Firefox OS.</p>
			<h4>How will proposals be evaluated?</h4>
			<p>The proposals will be assessed in terms of their research potential, level of advance expected throughout the year, and strength of the team. Notifications will be sent out by January 31st 2014 and the award will be made shortly thereafter. The evaluation will be done by the committee below.

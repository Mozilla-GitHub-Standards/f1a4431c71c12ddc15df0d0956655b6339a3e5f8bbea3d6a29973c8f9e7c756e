			<h1>Firefox Academic Center</h1>
			<h4>Mozilla and Telefónica are seeking proposals from faculty to explore novel capabilities and services on the first mobile operating system built for open web standards – <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/firefox/os/">FirefoxOS</a>. Upon review of proposals in 2013, one successful organization will receive a research award to establish the first Firefox Academic Center in 2014.</h4>
			<hr>
			<h4>What is Firefox OS?</h4>
			<p>FirefoxOS is Mozilla's open source mobile operating system based on Linux and Mozilla's Gecko technology. It relies on open web standards, is built from open source components, and provides a powerful application development platform. For web developers, FirefoxOS provides a mobile app development experience based on familiar open web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, even using open web API's to communicate with device hardware and services. FirefoxOS launches commercially in 2013.</p>
			<h4>What will be awarded?</h4>
			<p>To establish the first Firefox Academic Center, the winning organization will receive 30 <a href="http://www.geeksphone.com/">Geeksphone</a> Peak (or better) devices with SIM cards plus modest funds to cover data plans for an entire  year. One Mozilla and one Telefónica engineer will visit the organization and provide a 2-day bootcamp to familiarize researchers with the new web operating system. Further support will be available via the usual channels provided by Mozilla’s development community. At the end of the one year, the organization will be invited to Mozilla's headquarters in California to present their results and demo the technology developed. We anticipate further awards if the model is successful.</p>
			<h4>How do I submit a proposal?</h4>
			<p>Interested faculty should send a proposal by December 15th 2013. The proposal should be submitted in PDF and not exceed 4 pages in length. Proposals should describe the research vision and short-term goal for a one year timeframe, the team, and how the mobile devices will be used. A wide range of research topics in mobile computing is of interest, including (but not limited to):</p>
			<ul>
				<li>security of web apps;</li>
				<li>system support for network usage and energy consumption;</li>
				<li>integration across the mobile device and cloud platforms;</li>
				<li>structuring apps for browsers and mobile devices; and</li>
				<li>novel apps that highlight the capabilities of FirefoxOS.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>How will proposals be evaluated?</h4>
			<p>The proposals will be assessed in terms of their research potential, level of progress expected throughout the year, and strength of the team. Notifications will be sent out by January 31st 2014 and the award will be made shortly thereafter. The evaluation will be done by the committee below.
